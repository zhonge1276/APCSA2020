We ended up here after a long day of hiking (I clocked over 25,000 steps that day) and so we were starving by the time we arrived. The restaurant was *packed but that was a sign that the food would be *good (which it was) so we weren't *deterred. The service was a little *slow but I chalk that up to the fact that it was a *packed restaurant during dinner time on a Friday night. The staff was super *friendly and *attentive despite the volume of people in the restaurant. The food was well *worth the wait as it was *delicious and *filling. I was only able to finish all of my food because I was starving from the day *long hiking, otherwise I would've had to take the leftovers with me. Interesting tidbit, this was also the night the earthquake hit (July 5, 2019) so I experienced my first earthquake at this very establishment! Will be returning the next time I'm in LA.
